# ADS599_Capstone_Image_Recognition
Capstone project for image recognition application

## Description
With the medical resourceâ€™s shortage, we are trying to look for ways to make healthcare more efficient. Our group aims to use machine learning and deep learning techniques with image classification segments to deploy a product that can identify chest X-ray scans as either an image presenting with pneumonia or without pneumonia with a probability as a confidence score.

## Name of the Dataset
Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) 

## Dataset description:

Our dataset consists of 5,856 X-ray images that split into train, validate and test sets. Each set is categorized into "NORMAL" and "PNEUMONIA". For the training set, we have 1341 "NORMAL" images and 3875 "PNEUMONIA" images; For the validate set, we have 8 images each for "NORMAL" AND "PNEUMONIA"; And for the test set, we have 234 images for "NORMAL" and 390 images for "PNEUMONIA" which sums up at 5856 images total.
